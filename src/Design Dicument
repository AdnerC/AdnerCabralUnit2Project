LinearEquation class

Instance Variables:
private int x - This variable represents the x-coordinate
private int y - This variable represents the y-coordinate
private int x2 - This variable represents the second x-coordinate
private int y2 - This variable represents the second y-coordinate
private int x3 - This variable represents the x-coordinate that the user wants to check its spot on the function

Constructor
	public LinearEquation(int x, int y, int x2, int y2)

Methods:

public String toString()
This method will display all relevant information about this instance including:
X and Y coordinate information
Slope Intercept Form equation

public double SlopeCalc()
This method calculates the slope of the linear equation given the 2 points
returns double
will use (y2-y1)/(x2-x1) formula

public double InterceptCalc()
This method calculates the y intercept of the linear equation given the 2 points and slope
returns string with the fraction written in the "a/b" format

public double Distance()
This method calculates the distance between the 2 points using the distance formula
√[(x2-x1)²+(y2-y1)²]
returns a double with the information

public double NewX()
This method calculates the point on the linear function associated with the new x value
Inputs the x value into the linear equation to find the y value
returns a double with the y value

EquationRunner.java
Step 1: Ask user to enter first coordinate point
Step 2: Ask user to enter second coordinate point
Step 3: Create a new object using the LinearEquation class
Step 4: Run each method with the new object to preform the calculations required for the large print statement
Step 5: Ask user to enter another x value in order to calc the y
Step 6: print the new coordinate
