LinearEquation class

Instance Variables:
private double x - This variable represents the x-coordinate
private double y - This variable represents the y-coordinate
private double x2 - This variable represents the second x-coordinate
private double y2 - This variable represents the second y-coordinate
private double x3 - This variable represents the x-coordinate that the user wants to check its spot on the function

Constructor
	public LinearEquation(double x, double y, double x2, double y2)
	public LinearEquation(double x, double y, double x2, double y2, double x3)

Methods:

public String toString()
This method will display all relevant information about this instance including:
X and Y coordinate information
Slope Intercept Form equation
will be formating all major variable changes (slope being -/0, intercept being -/0, etc)

public String fractionConversion(double number)
this method will be used to convert decimal values to fractions, as well as properly format them


public double SlopeCalc()
This method calculates the slope of the linear equation given the 2 points
returns double
will use (y2-y1)/(x2-x1) formula


public double InterceptCalc()
This method calculates the y intercept of the linear equation given the 2 points and slope
returns string with the fraction written in the "a/b" format

public double Distance()
This method calculates the distance between the 2 points using the distance formula
√[(x2-x1)²+(y2-y1)²]
returns a double with the information

public double NewX()
This method calculates the point on the linear function associated with the new x value
Inputs the x value into the linear equation to find the y value
returns a double with the y value

EquationRunner.java
Step 1: Ask user to enter first coordinate point
Step 2: Ask user to enter second coordinate point
Step 3: Convert all string numbers to double
Step 4: Create a new object using the LinearEquation class
Step 5: Run each method with the new object to preform the calculations required for the large print statement
Step 6: Ask user to enter another x value in order to calc the y
Step 7: print the new coordinate
